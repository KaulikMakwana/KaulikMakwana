## 🚀 About Me

Started from an electrical engineering background and found my true spark in offensive security. I explore the cyber underground through red teaming, adversary emulation, and system exploitation. My journey is built on curiosity, broken systems, and hands-on experience — from Active Directory attacks and privilege escalation to web exploitation and custom tooling. I don't just learn; I build, break, and repeat.
